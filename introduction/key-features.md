# Key Features

#### **Drag-and-Drop Template Designer (WYSIWYG)**

Create layouts by simply dragging and placing elements on the canvas.\
Common elements include Text blocks, Images, Tables, Buttons, Containers, and sections.

#### **Dynamic Content Support**

The designer allows you to pull in data fields from backend systems.  Insert placeholders for customer data such as name, ID, account number, and transaction details exactly where you want in the template. \
The fields are replaced automatically when the communication is generated.

#### **AI Text Assist**

The designer includes a built-in AI feature that helps you refine and improve any text used in your template. If you are unsure about your wording, the AI analyzes the context, tone, and language and then suggests clearer and more suitable alternatives. This feature is designed for users who want to insert accurate, well-written text without manually rewriting every line.

#### Dynamic Variable Detection with AI

UniServe 360 includes an AI-driven capability that automatically identifies dynamic variables in an imported document. This reduces manual effort by detecting and highlighting fields that need to be mapped, helping you prepare the template faster and with fewer errors.

#### **Reusable Components**

Create components like headers, footers, banners, disclaimers, or format styles once and reuse them across templates.\
This reduces design time and keeps all templates consistent.

#### **Version Control**

The designer stores every version of your template.\
You can track updates, restore an older version, or see who made a change and when.

#### **Brand-Style Controls**

You can apply brand colors, fonts, headers, and footers. This ensures every communication looks consistent.&#x20;

#### **Flexible Layering**&#x20;

Layering allows multiple layouts to exist within a single template. We can choose the right layer(s) based on input flags or business rules.\
This reduces effort, keeps templates clean, and ensures that documents stay consistent across channels.

#### **Role-Based Access**

Administrators can control who can view, edit, review, or publish templates.

#### **Preview Before Publishing**

The designer shows how the template will look with sample customer data. This helps teams avoid formatting issues.

#### **Dynamic Business Rules**

Business rules can control:

* Layout changes
* Language selection
* Channel preference (email, SMS, print, etc.)
* Layer visibility

This ensures every customer receives content that matches their profile and preferences.

#### **Export and Publish**

Templates can be saved, tested, and published to UniServe 360's communication engine.\
Once published, these templates become part of your campaigns, notifications, and service-driven messages.

#### Unified View Across Multiple Lines of Business

Enterprises often have several business units (for example, savings accounts, current accounts, loans, credit cards, insurance). UniServe360 brings them together on a single platform so customers do not receive conflicting or disconnected messages.

#### Robust Data Management Engine

UniServe360 accepts inputs from various systems in formats like JSON, XML, database, and text files.\
Its data management module handles:

* Data transformation (converting from one form to another)
* Data validation (checking for accuracy)
* Data mapping (linking incoming data to template fields)
* Data computation (applying calculations)
* Data indexing (organizing data for quick access)
* Data consolidation (merging inputs into one dataset)

The processed data is stored as JSON in a central repository and becomes the source for all communication outputs.

#### **Multi-Channel Delivery Support**

UniServe360 supports statement delivery through:

* Web and self-care portals
* Email (HTML5, password-protected HTML/PDF)
* Print (AFP and PS)
* SMS notifications
* Mobile apps
* Interactive HTML5 statements

#### Real-time Engagement

HTML5-based interactive statements can:

* Play videos
* Enable online payments
* Allow ticket submission
* Support click-based upsell and cross-sell actions

These statements encourage real-time engagement.

#### **On-Demand Document Generation**

Customers or CSRs can request statements anytime through self-service portals or CRM. UniServe360 pulls indexed data instantly, maps it to the template, and generates the document on the fly.\
This reduces storage costs and speeds up response time.

#### Multilingual Output

The platform supports Unicode, allowing statements in any language. Output can be fully translated or delivered in dual-language formats based on customer preference.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">**Dynamic White Space Marketing**</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">Unused space on statements can display targeted marketing messages.</mark>\ <mark style="color:yellow;">Using rules and customer demographics (age, gender, location), UniServe360 selects suitable images or messages from the marketing repository.</mark>

#### Flexible Data Presentment

Templates can show:

* Summary-level information
* Section-wise breakdowns
* Detailed, itemized transactions
* Corporate (summary) and individual (detailed) views

All configurations are managed through UniServe360 layering feature.

#### **Interactive Hyperlinks and Personalization**

Clickable hyperlinks, personalized images, and dynamic elements can be added to make statements more engaging and action-oriented.

#### Lead Capture and Campaign Tracking

Emails or PDFs with embedded campaigns can capture customer clicks.\
UniServe360 records and indexes these interactions and triggers follow-up messages, helping convert interest into leads.

#### **Customer Profiling for Targeted Messaging**

Based on customer demographics and behavior, UniServe360 selects relevant marketing content.\
For example, age + gender + plan type + available white space = a targeted image/message is displayed.\
This improves campaign effectiveness and lead quality.

#### **Single View for CSR Agents**

CSR teams can view:

* Customer profiles
* Account details
* Past interactions
* Payment history
* Ticket status
* Modification logs

Agents update customer requests, and UniServe360 routes them to downstream systems and sends acknowledgments automatically.
