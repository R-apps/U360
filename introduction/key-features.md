# Key Features

#### **Drag-and-Drop Template Designer (WYSIWYG)**

Create layouts by simply dragging and placing elements on the canvas.\
Common elements include Text blocks, Images, Tables, Buttons, Containers, and sections.

#### **Local and Global Templates**

UniServe 360 supports Local and Global templates to help enterprises manage templates efficiently while maintaining consistency across communications.

**Global templates** hold common layouts, branding, and approved content that are reused across teams and use cases. Once created, global templates can be referenced by multiple local templates.

**Local templates** build on global templates and are specific to a business function, product, or use case; allowing controlled customization wherever needed.

#### **Dynamic Content Support**

Instead of maintaining multiple static templates, UniServe 360 supports **dynamic inserts** to vary text, values, or sections at runtime based on data and rules. During document generation, the system evaluates input data and business logic, then inserts the appropriate content in real time.

#### **AI Text Assist**

The designer includes a built-in AI feature that helps you refine and improve any text used in your template. If you are unsure about your wording, the AI analyzes the context, tone, and language and then suggests clearer and more suitable alternatives. This feature is designed for users who want to insert accurate, well-written text without manually rewriting every line.

#### **Import Template Design with AI-Assisted Variable Detection**

UniServe 360 supports importing an existing document design as a base template. The built-in AI feature scans the imported content and intelligently identifies dynamic fields such as names, dates, amounts, or account numbers that are likely to change per customer. These detected variables are highlighted and suggested for mapping, reducing the manual effort.

This capability helps teams onboard templates faster and accelerates the transition from static documents to fully dynamic, data-driven communications.

#### **Reusable Components**

Create components like headers, footers, banners, disclaimers, or format styles once and reuse them across templates.\
This reduces design time and keeps all templates consistent.

#### **Brand-Style Controls**

Apply brand colors, fonts, headers, and footers to ensure every communication looks consistent.&#x20;

#### **Flexible Layering**&#x20;

Layering allows multiple layouts to exist within a single template. We can choose the right layer(s) based on input flags or business rules.\
This reduces effort, keeps templates clean, and ensures that documents stay consistent across channels.

#### **Role-Based Access**

Administrators can control who can view, edit, review, or publish templates.

#### **Version Control**

Create and manage multiple versions of a template while preserving a complete history of changes. Each time a template is updated and checked in, a new version is created and stored. You can track updates, restore earlier versions, or see who made a change and when.

Unlike systems that allow only one active version, UniServe 360 supports multiple versions of the same template to run simultaneously. This helps regulated industries such as banking and insurance, where documents must reflect the exact terms, disclosures, and branding that were valid at the time of issuance.

#### **Preview Before Publishing**

The designer shows how the template will look with sample customer data. This helps teams avoid formatting issues.

#### **Dynamic Business Rules**

Business rules can control:

* Layout changes
* Language selection
* Channel preference (email, SMS, print, etc.)
* Layer visibility

This ensures every customer receives content that matches their profile and preferences.

#### **Export and Publish**

Templates can be saved, tested, and published to UniServe 360's communication engine.\
Once published, these templates become part of your campaigns, notifications, and service-driven messages.

#### Unified View Across Multiple Lines of Business

Enterprises often have several business units (for example, savings accounts, current accounts, loans, credit cards, insurance). UniServe360 brings them together on a single platform so customers do not receive conflicting or disconnected messages.

#### Robust Data Management Engine

UniServe360 accepts inputs from various systems in formats like JSON, XML, database, delimiter files, and APIs.\
Its data management module handles:

* Data transformation (converting from one form to another)
* Data validation (checking for accuracy)
* Data mapping (linking incoming data to template fields)
* Data computation (applying calculations)
* Data indexing (organizing data for quick access)
* Data consolidation (merging inputs into one dataset)

The processed data is stored as JSON in a central repository and becomes the source for all communication outputs.

#### **Multi-Channel Delivery Support**

UniServe360 supports statement delivery through:

* Web and self-care portals
* Email (HTML5, password-protected HTML/PDF)
* Print (AFP and PS)
* SMS notifications
* Mobile apps
* Interactive HTML5 statements
* <mark style="color:orange;">Shortlink messages</mark>

#### **Interactive Statements**

To encourage real-time engagement, UniServe 360 supports **HTML5-based interactive statements** that transform traditional documents into rich, engaging digital experiences.&#x20;

This allows high level of personalization allowing you to embed interactive elements such as videos, links, charts, and call-to-action buttons. Content can change in real time using business rules, ensuring each customer sees information that is relevant to them.

They are responsive, device-friendly, and well suited for web and mobile delivery.

#### **Real-time Document Generation**

UniServe 360 enables real-time document generation, eliminating the need to store large volumes of static PDFs. The system generate communications on demand using the template version and metadata that were valid at the time.

When a customer request pops up, UniServe360 pulls data instantly, maps it to the template, and generates the document on the fly. This approach reduces storage costs while still allowing users to access historical documents instantly and accurately whenever needed.

#### Batch Processing

UniServe 360 allows you to generate a large number of documents in a single run using one template and multiple records of input data. Instead of processing documents one by one, the system processes all records together as a batch.

#### Multilingual Output

The platform supports Unicode, allowing statements in any language. Output can be fully translated or delivered in dual-language formats based on customer preference.

#### **Dynamic White Space Marketing**

Unused space on statements can display targeted marketing messages.\
<mark style="color:orange;">Using rules and customer demographics (age, gender, location), UniServe360 selects suitable images or messages from the marketing repository.</mark>

#### Flexible Data Presentment

Templates can show:

* Summary-level information
* Section-wise breakdowns
* Detailed, itemized transactions
* Corporate (summary) and individual (detailed) views

All configurations are managed through UniServe360 layering feature.

#### Seamless System Integration

During processing, UniServe360 indexes metadata so other systems can reuse it.\
<mark style="color:orange;">It integrates with SMS gateways (SMSC), email systems (SMTP), CRM tools, and payment gateways.</mark>

#### **Interactive Hyperlinks and Personalization**

Clickable hyperlinks, personalized images, and dynamic elements can be added to make statements more engaging and action-oriented.

#### **Lead Capture and Campaign Tracking**

Emails or PDFs with embedded campaigns can capture customer clicks.\
UniServe360 records and indexes these interactions and triggers follow-up messages, helping convert interest into leads.

#### **Customer Profiling for Targeted Messaging**

Based on customer demographics and behavior, UniServe360 selects relevant marketing content.\
For example, age + gender + plan type + available white space = a targeted image/message is displayed.\
This improves campaign effectiveness and lead quality.

#### **Single View for CSR Agents**

CSR teams can view:

* Customer profiles
* Account details
* Past interactions
* Payment history
* Ticket status
* Modification logs

Agents update customer requests, and UniServe360 routes them to downstream systems and sends acknowledgments automatically.
