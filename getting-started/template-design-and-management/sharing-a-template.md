# Sharing a Template

The **Share** option allows you to make a template available to other users or teams within the \
UniServe 360 environment. It helps ensure collaboration, reuse, and controlled access to communication templates.

This feature lets you share your template with others in your domain.

<mark style="color:orange;">Authorized users can view or work on the shared template based on the permissions assigned.</mark>

#### When to Use?

Share a template when you want to:

* collaborate with multiple teams on the same template
* reuse a standardized template across departments
* allow reviewers or approvers to access the template

> #### Best Practices

> * Use clear naming and versioning before sharing

1. <mark style="color:orange;">When a template is shared, will the receiver gets any notification? And when the receiver opens/makes changes to it, does the sharer gets any notification?</mark>
2. <mark style="color:orange;">I didn't find an option to restrict the access when sharing a template. Are restrictins available? If so, how to apply?</mark>
