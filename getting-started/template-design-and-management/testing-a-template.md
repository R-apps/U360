# Testing a Template

#### Why testing is important?

Testing helps you ensure that the template is production-ready and reliable. It ensures:

* Accurate data rendering
* Correct application of business rules
* Consistent layout across pages
* Compliance with branding and regulatory requirements

#### How to test?

After creating your template, test it to see how it behaves. You can test it either with the sample or real input data.&#x20;

To test a template,

* Go to **Execute** and select **Test Process**
* Upload the test data source file (XML, JSON, DB, or Text file)
* Expand **More Settings** to select index and output format

Click **Process** to run the template with the uploaded data. Post processing, the processed template is downloaded in PDF to your default local storage.

When uploading sample data, ensure it covers all relevant conditions and business rules. This helps verify that the template processes data accurately and behaves as expected across different scenarios.
