# Channel Profiles

Channel profiles (SMS, Email, Print) come into play after the document is generated and distributed, but before the message is actually delivered to the end user. They enable you to deliver it through the indexed channel. Each profile defines connection and delivery settings for a channel.

Think of them as channel-specific delivery instructions. By indexing the profile, you instruct \
UniServe 360 core engine to send them through the respective channel.&#x20;

### Example:

A bank generates monthly account statements:

* _Email Profile_: Sends PDF to customer email
* _Print Profile_: Routes the same PDF to bulk print

Same document - different profiles, different channels.
