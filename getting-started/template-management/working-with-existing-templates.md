# Working with Existing Templates

Templates are stored either in the local path or in the server. Templates that are stored in the local path are accessible only by the [Template owner](#user-content-fn-1)[^1], while the templates stored in the server are accessible by all users in the domain.

To access a template stored in your local path, go to **Template** > **Open** > **Local Templates** and select the template from your local path.

{% hint style="info" %}
Alternatively, you can simply use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl+O</kbd> and drag and drop the template on to the canvas directly.&#x20;

If you try to open a template that is already open on the canvas, the system prompts you to either rename the template to proceed or close it.
{% endhint %}

To open a template saved on the server, navigate to **Template** > **Open** > **Server Templates**. Select the required template to view its preview, then click **Select** to open it.
