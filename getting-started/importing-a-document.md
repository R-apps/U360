# Importing a Document

The **Import Document** feature lets you bring an existing document (in PDF) into UniServe 360 and use it as the base design for your template. The platform converts the imported file into an editable layout, allowing you to overlay objects, map data fields, and rebuild the template quickly without designing everything from scratch. It

* Saves time by reusing an existing statement or letter format.
* Preserves branding, layout, and structure from the original document.
* Reduces design effort for repetitive or standard customer communications.

Let's see importing a document.

#### Using it as a reference layer&#x20;

To import,

* Create a new template and define its settings.
* Go to **Template** > **Import Document**. Browse to select the PDF file.
* The platform displays all the pages in the document.
* Select the page(s) to be imported.

Then, click **Import**. This imports the document as individual pages in the template designer.&#x20;

Then, to insert dynamic variables in the imported template, access the **Data Mapper** tab, expand \
**RAW** >**Input** >**Simple**. Click 'S' and select the required variables from the input data, to create simple objects. Click **Ok**.&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">**<\<IMAGE>>**</mark>

All these objects are accessible under the **Simple** tab in the RAW data.&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">**<\<IMAGE>>**</mark>

To insert these variables, simply drag and drop those variables on to the template at desired positions.

#### Using the Document

You can place text, images, tables, and dynamic fields directly on top of it. \
Combined with AI, UniServe 360 can also detect dynamic variables automatically, further cutting down manual work.&#x20;

Let's see how to mark the dynamic fields manually and using AI.

**Manual Process**

To mark dynamically,&#x20;
