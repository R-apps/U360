# Objects and Properties

All the objects are available in the left pane.&#x20;

To insert an object, simply click it. When you do, the platform opens up its basic display properties in the **Object** tab on the header menu, as you see here.&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">**<\<IMAGE - Shape's basic properties>>**</mark>

After you place the object on the designer, use these properties to quickly adjust its look and feel.

To view additional properties of an object, click the **Properties** tab in the right pane. \
The **Property Editor** displays the respective object properties. Set the object's properties as per your requirement.

<summary>Interactive Shapes</summary>

Use interactive drawing objects to design actionable and user-responsive templates. These objects enable user input, selection, or interaction when the output is viewed digitally (PDF, HTML, web forms).

<mark style="color:green;">**<\<IMAGE>>**</mark>

Interactive drawing objects are best suited for digital-first communications such as onboarding forms, service requests, and consent documents. They are commonly used in banking, insurance, and enterprise communications where customer confirmation, choices, or inputs are required—such as consent forms, service requests, onboarding documents, and applications.
